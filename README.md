# Coding_Example
I used Octave for Lagrange Interpolation and Lebesgue function

I thought this was a good representation of my coding style. I didn't follow a specific coding standard. This was an assignment for AMS 147 which I took in winter quarter for 2017. 

If you'd like to run the code and have Octave downloaded the files will be test_Lagrange_Interpolation.m and test_Lebesgue_function.m
